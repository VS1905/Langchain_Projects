The task of power generation and transmission \\nremained in the hands of the government controlled entities – \\nGenco and Transco. For distribution purposes, Delhi was divided \\ninto five zones, three of which were privatised. BSES assumed \\nGeneration:1\\nElectric power is created from energy-rich \\nsources like Coal (thermal energy), Wind, Water \\n(Hydro-electric energy) and the Sun (Solar \\nEnergy). From power plants, energy is \\ntransmitted at extra high voltage via \\ntransmission lines. Transmission:2\\nWith the help of Central Transco \\n(IPGCL) lines, power is transmitted \\nfrom the generation centres to the State \\nTransco (DTL). DTL Sub-stations step \\ndown voltage for supply to discoms.\\nDistribution3\\nThe distribution transformers \\nfurther reduce the voltage to \\n11kV and subsequently to 230V \\nand this power reaches over 2.4 \\nmillion consumers in South and \\nWest Delhi via cables and meter \\nboxes. \\nPOWER PL ANTHOW POWER IS GENER ATED AND DISTRIBUTEDcharge of two of these zones. Thus were born BSES Rajdhani Power \\nLimited and BSES Yamuna Power Limited.\\nBSES brings electricity to your homes, but it is not responsible for \\ngeneration and transmission. BRPL distributes power after sourcing \\nit from many generating stations spread across the country.\\nAGenco generates power and steps it up to 33/66 kV and then \\nto 220 kV before sending it to Transco.\\nBTransco receives power at 220 kV and steps it down to 66/33 \\nkV before sending it to discoms.\\nCDiscoms (BSES ) receive power at 66/33 kV and step it down \\nfurther to 11 kV before feeding it to the distribution \\ntransformers.\\nDFinally , thousands of BSES\\' distribution transformers step \\nthe power down to 0.4 kV and reaches it to your homes.Profile Overview\\n4 5July 1, 2002 mark ed a watershed moment in Delhi\\'s “power ” \\nhistory . It was the day, the Government of Delhi unbundled the \\nintegrated power utility and privatized its distribution wing as part \\nof its power sector reforms agenda.

The mantle was now \\nhanded over to BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), BSES \\nYamuna Power Limited (BYPL) and Tata Power Delhi Distribution \\nLimited (TPDDL).\\nDelhi\\'s tryst with power privatization has not only shown brilliant \\nresults operationally – a fact recognized by experts both nationally \\nand internationally .

For this, quality and capability \\nof meters, method of meter reading and billing play a vital role. \\nConforming to the stringent Indian and international \\nspecifications, our state-of-the-art meters have several interesting \\nfacts about them that you should know .  Some of them include:\\n•No manual intervention as the meter reading is \\ndownloaded \\n•Pulse blinks 3200 times to record 1 unit \\n•Record energy with a precision of + 1%\\n•Pass  stringent tests, including 29 tests as per IS standards, \\nbefore being installed in the field\\n•Earth Leakage (EL) indication in case of earth leakage in \\nwiring at the premises\\nCurrent\\nrangeDisplayLED\\nMeter  constant\\nDownloading  port\\nOutgoing\\nterminalIncoming\\n terminalEarth  LED\\nMeter  no. Energy Conservation \\nElectricity is a scarce \\ncommo dity, it mus t be used \\nprudently . Doing so will not only \\nhelp you conserve electricity , \\nbut also save money in the \\nprocess.  Here are some simple \\ntips.\\n•One of the best energy-\\nsaving devices is the light \\nswitch. Turn off the lights \\nwhen not required\\n•Avoid keeping electronic \\nappliances in the standby \\nmode. Switch them off from \\nthe main switch. Appliances \\non \\'stand by\\' mode continue \\nto be consume electricity\\n•Air conditioning accounts for \\nthe bulk of the power costs.  \\nFor the most comfort at the \\nleast cost, set your AC \\nthermostat at 25 degree C.  \\n•Line windows and walls with \\nplants to reduce air-\\nconditioning costs. They \\ninsulate rooms from heat, \\nleaving your air-conditioner \\nless work to do – reducing \\nenergy consumption in the \\nprocess.  \\n•Use star rated appliances. \\nEnergy efficient appliances consume two to 10 times less \\nelectricity than older , more \\nconventional models. \\nHigher the rating, the more \\nenergy and mone y you save.  \\n•Switch to LED - It is eight \\ntimes more energy efficient \\nthan an incandescent bulb \\nand twice energy efficient \\nthan a CFL. \\n•Switch off your computer \\nwhen not in use - Because \\neven when it\\'s in the sleep \\nmode, it is consuming \\nelectricity . The monitor uses \\nmore than half of the energy \\nconsumed. Turn it off e ven if \\nyou have to leave the \\ncomputer on\\n•Place your refrigerator away \\nfrom sunlight and walls - \\nMak e sure the refrigerator is \\nplaced away from any heat \\nsource including direct \\nsunlight. Allow enough \\nspace around the \\nrefrigerator for continuous \\nairflow . If the heat cannot \\nescape, the cooling system \\nwill have to work harder and \\nuse more energy .\\n•Prevent \\'Earth Leakages\\' - \\nAn \\'earth leakage\\' leads to \\n2518 19Power Consumption Guideelectricity wastage and \\nworse; it can turn a simple \\nenergy into an object of \\ndread – giving electric \\nshocks, which sometimes \\ncan be fatal. Avoid mishaps \\nwith the use of Earth \\nLeakage Protective Device \\n(ELCB) •Use a room heater with a \\nthermostat. It will help \\nprevent overheating, while \\nmaintaining your comfort \\nand saving you mone y on \\nyour energy bills.

These \\nshocks and mishaps can be avoided \\nby installing an Earth Leakage \\nCircuit Break er (ELCB). This simple yet a very useful device detects  \\neven a small “current to earth” (earth leakage ) in one\\'s premises, \\nautomatically tripping and disconnecting the electricity supply to \\nthe premises / equipment, thus preventing serious mishaps. \\nAnother useful benefit of installing an ELCB is that it also detects \\nfaulty and inter-mixing of internal wiring. On detection, the ELCB \\nimmediately trips, thus preventing potential wastage of electricity \\nand accidents. \\nUnder Section 61 A of the Indian Electricity Rules, 1956, it is \\nmandatory for all consumers, having an electricity load of 5 kW and \\nabove, to have an ELCB installed at their premises. In a recent order , \\nthe Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has directed \\nthe Delhi discoms to ensure strict adherence to Section 61 A of the \\nIndian Electricity Rules, 1956 and mak e the installation of an ELCB \\nmandatory and a pre requisite for providing a new connection. \\nFor your safety and security, \\nshift your meter to an \\naccessible place\\nIn the interest of your own safety , we \\nappeal to you – our esteemed consumers - \\nto get your electricity meters voluntarily \\nshifted to a safe, easily accessible and \\ncovered place outside the premises.
